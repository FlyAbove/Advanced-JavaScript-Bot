Contributing would be great as i'm a sole developer for this bot.

You can help contribute by:
* Translation language files (help with previous translations or make support for another language)
* Optimization on files. (Know a better way on a function, make a pull request and I'll have a look)
* Donating (Donating helps me stay motivated to providing open source code, that anyone can use)

**To join as a translator or contributing in the code in any means you can email at contact@flyabove.ml**
Your mail should contain:
- Your application type.
- Your experience in JavaScript or any programming language (if applying as a contributor).
- Your time zone.
- Your working hours and when you are available.
- Why do you want to join this project.
- Why should we select you instead of someone else?

# Note:
Mass sending emails on the given email address would lead your email id black listed.
